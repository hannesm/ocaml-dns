  (** [retrieve_certificate ~ca stack ~dns_key ~hostname ~key_seed server_ip port]
     generates a RSA private key (using the [key_seed]), a certificate
     signing request for the given [hostname] and [additional_hostnames], and
     sends [server_ip] an nsupdate (DNS-TSIG with [dns_key]) with the csr as
     TLSA record, awaiting for a matching certificate as TLSA record. Requires a
     service that interacts with let's encrypt to transform the CSR into a
     signed certificate. If something fails, an exception (via [Lwt.fail]) is
     raised. This is meant for unikernels that require a valid TLS certificate
     before they can start their service (i.e. most web servers, mail
     servers). Has let's encrypt certificates (expiry March 2021) hardcoded. *)
